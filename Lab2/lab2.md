The following work is from lab 2 in Robotics. 

We firsly Rebuilt the Robot and tested its functionality. 
We then used Github to get our program's from Lab1 and added some additional features such as the PID algorithm. 

this basically ensures that both motors are at the same level of power and are constantly readjusted and calibrated. 

We redone the Lab1 Q1 exercise of the Square. 
<insert code>

We then went on to enable the motor Sync function to ensure that if one motor was stopped the other would also stop. 

Then we modified this code by syncing the motors B and C but only giving power to one of the motors.  The robot successfully went in a Straight Line.

While Eric helped draw up the labrynth with other class mates. Craig resumed building the code for the Labrythn Challenge. This was a success and the team got the labrynth challenge to work. We also included the PID algorithm to ensure that both motors were in sync.

Next Eric done Question 9, the Random Labrythn challenge. But we did not get a chance to test this out as the we ran out of time
