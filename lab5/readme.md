Hi Craig, Apologies cant be there today.
In this folder I have done all of the following:

1. motor encoder - i.e calculating the speed and distance. remember that
360 = 1 turn so. 1800 = 5 turns. try measure how far in CM what 1 pass is. 

2. motor encoder target distances. This works on the principal that if you set a target the motors turn til this distance. the motors then begin to slow down. 

3. using the light sensor. make sure you read the comments in the code to see whats going on. 

important. learn how to set the threshold. instructions are in the comments on light sensor threshold. 
when you do set the threshold this program will make the robot run until 
it meets a black line

4. using the light sensor to follow a line in an infinite loop

5. same as 5 but with the touch sensor to stop the robot, ie a wall or object 

enjoy man, hope these programs work. if not we can fly through them together next week. 

take it easy man.
